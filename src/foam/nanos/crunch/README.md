## CRUNCH - Continuous Reactive User Nano-Capability Hierarchy

CRUNCH is a [Knowledge-Based Configuration System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge-based_configuration) that configures a user's account with various capabilities based upon the features and functionalities.
Using CRUNCH we model all the potential capabilities of a user along with various compliance, onboarding, security, and approval requirements of those capabilities. Those models form a knowledge-graph which allows CRUNCH to query for set of capabilities and receive sets of onboarding requirements.
CRUNCH uses this knowledge graph to dynamically generate onboarding wizards for the particular configuration or set of capabilities that a user has requested, as well as dynamically add capabilities to a user's account at run-time and provide a gradual onboarding experience.
For more information on CRUNCH as a solution to the onboarding problem, and some concrete use cases of CRUNCH, please visit the [CRUNCH wiki](https://github.com/nanoPayinc/NANOPAY/wiki/CRUNCH)
